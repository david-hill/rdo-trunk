  ## Deploying DPDK requires enabling hugepages for the overcloud compute nodes.
  ## It also requires enabling IOMMU when using the VFIO (vfio-pci) OvsDpdkDriverType.
  ## This can be done using ComputeKernelArgs as shown below.
  ComputeParameters:
    #ComputeKernelArgs: "intel_iommu=on default_hugepagesz=2MB hugepagesz=2MB hugepages=2048"
    ## Attempting to deploy DPDK without appropriate values for the below parameters may lead to unstable deployments
    ## due to CPU contention of DPDK PMD threads.
    OvsEnableDpdk: True
    ## It is highly recommended to to enable isolcpus (via ComputeKernelArgs) on compute overcloud nodes and set the following parameters:
    #OvsDpdkSocketMemory: ""       # Sets the amount of hugepage memory to assign per NUMA node.
                                   # It is recommended to use the socket closest to the PCIe slot used for the
                                   # desired DPDK NIC.  Format should be comma separated per socket string such as:
                                   # "<socket 0 mem MB>,<socket 1 mem MB>", for example: "1024,0".

                                   # physical core.  Also, specifying more than one core will trigger multiple PMD
